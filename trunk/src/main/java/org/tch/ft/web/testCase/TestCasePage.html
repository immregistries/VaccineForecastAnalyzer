		<h1>Test Case</h1>
		<p>A Test Case represents a specific scenario and contains enough
			information for a basic patient record to be created in an IIS.</p>
		<div wicket:id="selected">
			<h1 wicket:id="testCaseLabel"></h1>
			<p>The Test Case detail page shows the basic information for the
				test case, the associated events (vaccinations) and the status of
				this test case within the context of the currently selected Test
				Panel. If the test case is part of the current test panel and you
				are assigned Expert or Admin role to the Task Group, you can edit
				the test case.</p>
			<h3>Test Case</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Label</b> A short description of what this test case
					tests.</li>
				<li><b>Description</b> A complete description of what this test
					case tests.</li>
				<li><b>Patient</b> The assigned (not-real) name and sex of the
					patient.</li>
				<li><b>DOB</b> The date of birth for testing.</li>
				<li><b>Evaluation Date</b> The date to target the forecast at.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Events</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Type</b> Type of event that occurred. This is normally a
					Vaccination, but could also be a contraindicatin or other
					condition.</li>
				<li><b>Item</b> The particular concept, normally a specific
					vaccination.</li>
				<li><b>CVX</b> The CDC assigned CVX code, if this is a
					vaccination.</li>
				<li><b>MVX</b> The CDC assigned manufacturer code, if this is a
					vaccination.</li>
				<li><b>Date</b> The date the event occurred, normally the
					vaccination date.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Assigned to Test Panel</h3>
			<p>A single test case can be assigned to more than one panel.
				This section shows the values for this test case for the currently
				selected test panel. This means that a single test may "Pass" under
				one test panel and "Fail" in another. This situation would occur
				when a single test case works for one IIS and not for another.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Category Name</b> The category this test case is
					assigned under in the test panel.</li>
				<li><b>Test Case Number</b> The unique number assigned by the
					Task Group when this test case was assigned to the test panel.</li>
				<li><b>Include Status</b> Whether nor this test case is
					assigned as part of this test panel. Once added a test case is
					never fully removed, instead it is marked as "Excluded". "Proposed"
					test cases are ones that have been provisionally added and are
					waiting for approval from the rest of the group.</li>
				<li><b>Result Status</b> Indicates the current status of this
					test case for testing purposes. This is used to help communication
					between Task Group experts, and is not automatically updated when a
					test is run.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Test Results</h2>
			<p>A comparison of the actual vs expected values. This page will
				show all expected and actual values with the currently selected Task
				Groups expected values compared with the currently selected
				Software. For most test cases there is only one set of actuals vs
				expected, but some test cases, particular for combinations, may have
				additional tests for each antigen. In these case the actuals and
				expected are repeated.</p>
			<h3>Set Expected Values for ...</h3>
			<p>This form allows for quickly indicated the expected values for
				this test case. Every test case can have an official expected value
				from any Task Group that has this test case in a Test Panel. In
				addition, any Expert can add their personal expected values. If you
				are currently assigned as an expert on a panel that includes this
				test case then your expectations will become the official
				expectations for this test panel. Otherwise your expectations will
				be displayed only under your name. (You do not have the ability to
				change the expectations for any Task Group that you are not an
				Expert or Admin on. )</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Dose</b> The dose number that is expected next.</li>
				<li><b>Valid</b> The earliest date when the next (or first)
					vaccination could be given. (This does not include any additional
					grace period that the forecaster may allow for in retrospective
					analysis.)</li>
				<li><b>Due</b> The date when this vaccination would normally be
					recommended. This includes any acceleration due to being behind
					schedule. This is the date when the patient would normally be asked
					to return for the first or additional vaccinations.</li>
				<li><b>Overdue</b> The first date when the next (or first)
					vaccination should have already been given. Optimally the patient
					should be scheduled for and received a vaccination by this date.
					After this point the patient is considered "behind". This value has
					a higher variability among systems as it depends on both
					recommendations and local policy.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Change Test Status for ...</h3>
			<p>This table allows Task Group experts to quickly change the
				status of this test case for the currently selected test case panel
				in context of how well this forecast test case is handled by the
				primary software system listed in the title.</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Add Expected Values</h3>
			<p>Similar to the Set Expected values above accept this form
				allows for setting expectations for any forecast line and the
				results are not entered as the official expectations for this Test
				Panel.</p>

				<a href="ActualVsExpectedPage" class="fauxbutton">Test Results</a>
			</wicket:link>
			</p>
			<h2>Forecast Log</h2>
			<p>When the test case is run against the selected forecast test
				system the log with details about what occurred are recorded here.
				This information is useful for troubleshooting, but may not make
				sense unless familiar with how the selected software system works.</p>
			<p>

				</wicket:link>
			</p>
			<h2>Comments</h2>
			<p>Any Expert may leave comments on any test case and read all
				comments on a test case. Remember, do not put confidential or private
				information in the comments as they will be visible to any
				registered system user. The comments are a common bulletin board for
				notes and comments that can be shared between Task Group members and
				other Experts.</p>
