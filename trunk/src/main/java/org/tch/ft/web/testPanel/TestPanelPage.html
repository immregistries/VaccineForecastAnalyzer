		<h1>Test Panel</h1>
		<p>A Test Panel is a set of Test Cases that have been grouped
			together by a Task Group for a common testing purpose. Test Cases in
			this system are global, any Test Case, defined by any Task Group may
			be included in any other Task Group's Test Panel. This then allows
			for the development of common shared test cases.</p>

				<h3>Add Test Case</h3>
				<p>Adding an new test case is simple. The following information
					is needed to create a test case:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Label</b> This is a human readable, short description
						of the test case and will appear labeled as such in any test panel
						this test case is associated with. This field is required.</li>
					<li><b>Description</b> A long description that describes what
						is being tested here in a way that is understandable to other
						experts. Remember that this test case may be viewed and selected
						for inclusion in other test panels. Please be clear here.</li>
					<li><b>Patient First</b> A first name is required in order to
						support testing systems that require a patient name. A random name
						is automatically generated for you. You may change the name, if
						needed, but do not put real patient data here!</li>
					<li><b>Patient Last</b> A last name is required in order to
						support testing systems that require a patient name. A random name
						is automatically generated for you. You may change the name, if
						needed, but do not put real patient data here!</li>
					<li><b>Patient Sex</b> A patient sex of 'F' is automatically
						assigned. This field is required to support testing systems that
						require this field.</li>
					<li><b>Birth Date</b> The date the patient was born for
						testing purposes. The forecast is generated based on this date.</li>
					<li><b>Evaluation Date</b> The date when the evaluation should
						be conducted for. It defaults to today's date when creating the
						test case. Not all forecast system support this date.</li>
					<li><b>Category Name</b> The label you want to use when this
						test case is assigned to the test panel. This label is specific to
						the test panel it is assigned to. Be sure to use consistent values
						here in order for similar tests to be grouped together properly.
						If this test case is later added to other test panels it will be
						associated with a its own category name.</li>
					<li><b>Test Case Number</b> A unique identifier for this test
						case within this test panel. This field is optional but if valued
						must not match any test cases that are currently defined for this
						test panel.</li>
				</ul>
