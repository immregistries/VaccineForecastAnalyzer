				Group can set expectations to test cases that become the official
				expectation of the Task Group. Other Experts, who are either View
				members or not assigned as members may view the associated test
				panels, test cases, and comments, but if they record expectations
				they will be displayed as their personal expectations and will not
				be registered under the Task Group.</p>
